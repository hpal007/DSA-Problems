Time complexity 

O(1) >> O(logN) >> O(N) >> O(NlogN) >> O(N^2) >> O(N^logN) >> O(2^N) >> O(N!)

Complexity	    Notation	Definition	Example
Constant	    O(1)	    Execution time is constant, independent of input size.	Accessing an element in an array by index.
Logarithmic	    O(log N)	Execution time increases logarithmically as input size grows.	Binary search in a sorted array.
Linear	        O(N)	    Execution time increases linearly with input size.	Iterating through all elements in an array.
Linearithmic    O(N log N)	Execution time increases in proportion to N times log N.	Merge sort and quicksort algorithms.
Quadratic	    O(N^2)	    Execution time increases quadratically with input size.	Bubble sort or nested loops.
Polynomial	    O(N^log N)	Execution time grows polynomially with respect to N.	Specific algorithms (less common).
Exponential	    O(2^N)	    Execution time doubles with each additional element.	Recursive Fibonacci calculation (naive).
Factorial	    O(N!)	    Execution time grows factorially with respect to N.	Generating all permutations of a set.
